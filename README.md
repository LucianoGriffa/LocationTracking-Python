# Tracking Location with IP or URL

This code serves to obtain geolocation information of a specific IP address or URL. By providing an IP address or URL as input, the code utilizes a geolocation API to retrieve data such as the country, region, city, postal code, and internet service provider associated with that address.

This can be useful in various scenarios, including:

- Verifying the geographic location of a server or website through its IP address.
- Tracking the location of an online visitor or user.
- Identifying the country or region of origin for a suspicious or malicious IP address.
- Gaining geographical information for analysis and statistics in applications and services.
